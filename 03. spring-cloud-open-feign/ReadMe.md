# **Spring Cloud Open Feign**

In a microservices architecture, different services often need to communicate with each other over HTTP. OpenFeign simplifies this communication by allowing developers to define interfaces annotated with @FeignClient that specify the desired HTTP endpoints and methods. These interfaces act as proxies for the remote services.
